<h2>Short Bio</h2>
<p>Lata Mangeshkar was born in Indore on September 28, 1929, and became, 
    quite simply, the most popular playback singer in Bollywood's history.
    She sung for over 50 years for actresses from Nargis to Preity Zinta,
   as well as recorded albums of all kinds (ghazals, pop, etc). Until 
   the 1991 edition, when her entry disappeared, the Guinness Book of 
   World Records listed her as the most-recorded artist in the world 
   with not less than 30,000 solo, duet,and chorus-backed songs recorded 
   in 20 Indian languages between 948 and 1987. Today that number may had reached 40,000!</p>
<p>
    Lata recorded songs in over thirty-six Indian languages and a 
    few foreign languages, though primarily in Marathi, Hindi, and 
    Bengali.Her foreign languages included English, Russian, Dutch,
     Nepali, and Swahili.She received several accolades and honors
    throughout her career. In 1989, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was
     bestowed on her by the Government of India.In 2001, in 
     recognition of her contributions to the nation, she was 
     awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour; 
     she is only the second female singer, after M. S. Subbulakshmi,
    to receive this honour.France conferred on her its highest 
    civilian award, Officer of the National Order of the Legion of
     Honour, in 2007.

    Lata was named "Hema" at her birth. Her parents later renamed her 
    Lata after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's 
    plays, भाव बंधन.She was the eldest child in the family. Meena,
     Asha, Usha and Hridaynath, in birth order, are her siblings; 
     all are accomplished singers and musicians.She received her
      first music lesson from her father. At the age of five, 
      she started to work as an actress in her father's musical
       plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi). On her first day of school
       ,Mangeshkar left because she was not allowed to bring her 
       sister Asha along with her.</p>

    <b>
        Lata Mangeshkar: I do not consider myself as a reflective, 
        brooding person. I would just end up tying myself in knots.
         Time has gone by in a blur, the beginnings seem just 
         like yesterday. Today there’s that instinct to do more. 
     <i>I would like to continue singing till my voice gives up on me. Singing is all that I know.</i>
